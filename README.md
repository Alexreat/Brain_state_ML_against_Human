This biomedical research project explores the potential relationship between genetic alterations, specifically in GRIN2B mutated rats, and sleep disorders. The research involves the processes of cleaning, classifying, and analyzing raw sleep recording and imaginary coherence data. 

The objective of this study was to examine if these data could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for GRIN2B neurodevelopmental disorders. As part of the analysis, the study also compares automatic and manual sleep scoring methods, focusing on Wake, NonREM, and REM sleep stages.

Our results indicate a high accuracy in identifying Wake and NonRem states using automatic sleep scorer. However, its performance in classifying REM sleep was less precise, signifying a need for further calibration. 

The project encapsulates the use of statistical analyses to validate the effectiveness of the scoring software and also assesses its potential applications in both sleep research and clinical settings.

To explore this in detail, our analysis evaluated the data distribution and variance consistency across all three brain states. Furthermore, a deeper investigation was carried out into each sleep stage. The analysis found no significant difference between the manual and automatic sleep scoring methods for NonREM and Wake sleep stages, implying both techniques can be reliably used for scoring these sleep stages. 

However, a significant difference was identified in classifying REM sleep states between the two methods, highlighting a potential inconsistency and necessity for further investigation.
